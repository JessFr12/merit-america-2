# Generating database diagrams

To help visualize the structure of a database, you can generate basic database diagrams using pgAdmin.

To get started, select a database in the Browser pane. For example, select `PizzaShop`.

Next, on the **Object** menu, select **Generate ERD**, and an initial diagram is displayed.

You can then rearrange the elements of the diagram by clicking and dragging. Clicking and dragging on the background moves the entire diagram, and you can zoom in and out using the mouse wheel (or the **Zoom in** and **Zoom out** buttons on the toolbar).

After rearranging and adjusting the zoom, here's what a diagram of the `PizzaShop` database might look like:
